# MathGame

## What i learned
- Learned to use lists in C# and the diference of it and arrays
- Delegates: Learned how to pass a method as a parameter for another method using delegates
- Stopwatch
- Reinforced what i previously learned

## Requirements

- Create a math game using the four operations
- It must show a menu asking the user to choose an operation
- The results from division should result in INTERGERS ONLY, and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
- A random operation is showed to the user and he has to type an answer
- Record previous games in a list and have an option to visualize the history of previous games on the menu
- You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.

## Challenges

- Try to implement levels of difficulty.
- Add a timer to track how long the user takes to finish the game.
- Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations
- To follow the DRY Principle, try using just one method for all games. Additionally, double check your project and try to find opportunities to achieve the same functionality with less code, avoiding repetition when possible.
